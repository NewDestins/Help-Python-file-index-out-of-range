# Help-Python-file-index-out-of-range
I need help with my code

Hello. I started learning python and wanted to create a game out of a tutorial and it went great. My code ran and it had no problems, I closed my laptop and decided to sleep. When i woke up, I tried to run it again and it gave me index out of range error and I tried to fix it for hours now but in vain. I don't know if it's from my files, the laptop (macbook air m1) or anything else but i can't figure it out.
